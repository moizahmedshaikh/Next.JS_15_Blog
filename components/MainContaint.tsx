            What is Next.JS?
          </h1>

          <p className="content mt-[0.9rem]">
            Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of
            ReactJS library, that enables the creation of high-performance,
            scalable applications with Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site
            Generation (SSG), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), simplified
            routing, image optimization, code splitting, middleware, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="content mt-[2.5rem]">
            Developed and maintained by Vercel, Next.js simplifies the
            development process by providing a standard structure and built-in
            solutions for common web development challenges, allowing NextJS
            development company to focus on writing code in React rather than
            configuring tools.

            Support for React 19 RC
          </h1>

          <p className="content mt-[1rem]">
            Next.js 15 RC fully supports React 19 RC, including the new React
            Compiler, which is currently in an experimental phase. This
            integration promises significant performance enhancements and more
            efficient hydration error handling. The React Compiler aims to
            optimize code automatically, reducing the need for manual
            optimizations using hooks like useMemo and useCallback.

          </h1>

          <p className="content mt-[1rem]">
            The React Compiler, developed by the React team, automatically
            optimizes code by analyzing JavaScript semantics and applying
            optimizations. This reduces manual tasks like using useMemo or
            useCallback.

          <p className="content mt-[1rem]">
          The next/after API is another experimental feature in Next.js 15 RC. This feature enables developers to perform secondary tasks or cleanup operations without blocking the primary response. This addition provides more flexibility in handling post-response logic, allowing for cleaner and more efficient code management. Potential use cases include analytics logging, resource cleanup, or additional data fetching after the initial response.

          <p className="content mt-[1rem]">
          Hydration errors, which occur due to mismatches between server-rendered and client-rendered content, have been a common issue in Next.js. Building upon the enhancements made in Next.js 14.1, Next.js 15 further improves the NextJS developer experience when encountering hydration errors. The hydration error view now includes more informative error messages, source code snippets, and suggestions for resolving the issues, making debugging more efficient.
