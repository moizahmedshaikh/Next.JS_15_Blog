            <p className='content text-xl mt-7'>Next.js is an open-source React framework that has become a key player in modern web development. Developed by Guillermo Rauch and released by Vercel (formerly ZEIT) in 2016 Next.js simplifies the process of building optimized, scalable web applications. By offering features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), it allows developers to enhance performance and SEO out of the box

            <p className='content text-xl mt-7'>Over time, Next.js has seen numerous updates that have significantly expanded its capabilities. The frameworkclss journey began with Next.js 1.0, which introduced core features such as automatic server rendering and code splitting. Version 2.0, released in March 2017, focused on enhancing development for smaller projects, improving build efficiency, and scaling the hot-module replacement (HMR) feature. In 2018, Next.js 7.0 brought support for Reacts Context API and introduced improvements in dynamic routing.As Next.js evolved, it introduced cutting-edge features that reshaped web development. Version 9.3, released in 2020, added support for Sass and CSS Modules, while the following version, 9.5, introduced Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), enabling content updates without rebuilding the entire site. Next.js 10, released in 2020, further refined the framework with built-in image optimization, enhancing page load speeds.Version 11, released in 2021, focused on improving developer experience with features like real-time collaboration tools and Webpack 5 support. The addition of Rust-based compilers in Next.js 12 (October 2021) boosted performance, while also introducing Edge Functions and Middleware for more dynamic routing. The release of Next.js 13 in late 2022 marked a turning point with the introduction of the App Router, React Server Components, and streaming support, laying the groundwork for the highly anticipated Turbopack bundler.
